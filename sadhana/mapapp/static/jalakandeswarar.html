Jalakandeswarar Temple is a historic Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located within the Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu. The main deity, Jalakandeswarar, is worshipped as Lord Shiva residing in water, as the temple was originally surrounded by a water body. The temple features classic Vijayanagara architecture, with a tall gopuram (gateway tower), intricately carved pillars, and mandapams (pillared halls) housing the main shrine. Devotees also worship Sri Akhilandeshwari Amman, the consort of Shiva, within the complex. Over centuries, the temple faced neglect but was revived in the 1980s, and it now stands as a prominent spiritual and historical landmark, attracting pilgrims and tourists alike.
