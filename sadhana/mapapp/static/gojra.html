Gojra Fort is a historic hill fort located on Naammam Malai hill near Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Built in 1678 by the Maratha forces during the siege of Vellore Fort, the fort provided a strategic vantage point overlooking the plains, allowing attackers to monitor and bombard the main fort. Unlike larger palace-like structures, Gojra Fort was primarily a military outpost with walls and bunkers designed for defense. Today, the fort stands in ruins, but it continues to offer panoramic views of Vellore and serves as a reminder of the region's rich military history, attracting both history enthusiasts and trekking lovers.
